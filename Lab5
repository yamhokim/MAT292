%% Second-Order Lab: Second-Order Linear DEs in MATLAB
%
%
% In this lab, you will learn how to use |iode| to plot solutions of 
% second-order ODEs. You will also learn to classify the behaviour of 
% different types of solutions.
%
% Moreover, you will write your own Second-Order ODE system solver, and 
% compare its results to those of |iode|.
%
% Opening the m-file lab5.m in the MATLAB editor, step through each
% part using cell mode to see the results.
%
% There are seven (7) exercises in this lab that are to be handed in on the
% due date of the lab.

%% Iode for Second-Order Linear DEs with constant coefficients
% 
% In the |iode| menu, select the |Second order linear ODEs| module.
% It opens with a default DE and a default forcing function |f(t) =
% cos(2t)|. The forcing function can be plotted along with the solution by
% choosing |Show forcing function| from the |Options| menu.
%
% Use this module to easily plot solutions to these kind of equations.
%
% There are three methods to input the initial conditions:
%
% Method 1. Enter the values for |t0|, |x(t0)|, and |x'(t0)| into the
% |Initial conditions| boxes, and then click |Plot solution|.
%
% Method 2. Enter the desired slope |x'(t0)| into the appropriate into the
% |Initial conditions| box, and then click on the graph at the point
% |(t0,x(t0))| where you want the solution to start.
%
% Method 3. Press down the left mouse button at the desired point
% |(t0,x(t0))| and drag the mouse a short distance at the desired slope
% |x'(t0)|. When you release the mouse button, |iode| will plot the
% solution.

%% Growth and Decay Concepts
%
% We want to classify different kinds of behaviour of the solutions. We say
% that a solution:
%
% |grows| if its magnitude tends to |infinity| for large values of |t|, that
% is, if either the solution tends to $+\infty$ or $-\infty$,
%
% |decays| if its magnitude converges to |0| for large values of |t|,
%
% |decays while oscillating| if it keeps changing sign for large values of
% |t| and the amplitude of the oscillation tends to zero,
%
% |grows while oscillating| if it keeps changing sign for large values of
% |t| and the amplitude of the oscillation tends to infinity.

% |Remark.| A function which |grows while oscillating| doesn't |grow|,
% because it keeps changing sign, so it neither tends to $+\infty$ nor to
% $-\infty$.

%% Exercise 1
%
% Objective: Use |iode| to solve second-order linear DEs. And classify
% them.
%
% Details: Consider the ODE:
%
%  4y'' + 4 y' + 17 y = 0
%
% (a) Use |iode| to plot six (6) numerical solutions of this equation with
% "random" initial data (use Method 3 above) and press-and-drag at various
% initial points, with some of the slopes being positive and some negative)
%
% Use only initial points in the part of the window where |0<t<1| and
% |-1<x<1| and take all initial slopes between |-3| and |+3|.
%
% Change the window to |[0,10]x[-3,3]|.
% Attach a cropped screenshot to your answers file.
% 
% (b) Based on the results of (a), state what percentage of solutions 
% decay, grow, grow while oscillating, or decay while oscillating.

% All solutions decaying while oscillating

% (c) Solve the DE and write the exact solution. Explain why this justifies
% your answer in (b).

% Exact Solution: y(t) = c1e^(-t/2)*cos(2t) + c2e^(-t/2)sin(2t)

% Both the sin and cos terms in the solution are accompanied by an
% exponential term with a negative power. This guarantees that both terms
% will approach zero as time approaches zero, justifying that the solutions
% decays while oscillating.

%% Exercise 2
%
% Consider the ODE:
%
%  y'' + sqrt(3) y' - y/4 = 0
%
% Repeat (a), (b), (c) from Exercise 1 with this DE.
%

% Part a)

% Part b)

% All solutions grow as time increases. i.e. all solutions move away from
% x = 0 as t -> infinity.

% Part c)
% Exact solution: y(t) = c1*e^((-sqrt(3)+2)/2)*t + c2*e^((-sqrt(3)-2)/2)*t

% Aside from the case where c1 is equal to 0, as long as t
% approaches positive infinity or negative infinity, the function will
% continue to grow since there will always be an exponential raised to a
% positive term.

%% Exercise 3
%
% Consider the ODE:
%
%  y'' + sqrt(3) y' + y/4 = 0
%
% Repeat (a), (b), (c) from Exercise 1 with this DE.
% 
% Part a)

% Look at attached png for exercise 3

% Part b)

% All solutions decay as time goes on.

% Part c)

% Exact Solution: y = c1*e^((-sqrt(3)+sqrt(2))*x / 2) +
% c2*e^((-sqrt(3)-sqrt(2)) / 2)

% From the solution, we can see that both exponentials involved in the
% solution are decaying, thus justifying that the solution itself will
% always be decaying aside from the specific case in which both c1 and c2
% are equal to zero.

%% Example
%
% Consider the ODE:
%
%  y'' + 2y' + 10y = 0
% 
% The solution is
%
%  y(t) = e^(-t) ( c1 cos(3t) + c2 sin(3t) )
%
% From this, it is easy to see that all solutions decay while oscillating.
%
% Similarly, for the equation 
%
%  y'' - 2y' + 10y = 0
% 
% The solution is
%
%  y(t) = e^t ( c3 cos(3t) + c4 sin(3t) )
%
% which grows while oscillating.

%% Exercise 4
%
% Consider the fourth-order ODE:
%
%  y'''' + 2 y''' + 6 y'' + 2 y' + 5 y = 0
%
% (a) Find the general solution for this problem. You can use MATLAB to 
% find the roots of the characteristic equation numerically with |roots|.
%
% The general solution to the problem is:
% y(t) = c1*e^(-t)*sin(2t) + c2*sin(t) + c3*e^(-t)*cos(2t) + c4*cos(t)
%
% (b) Predict what percentage of solutions with random initial data will 
% grow, decay, grow while oscillating, and decay while oscillating. Explain.
% 
% Based on the form of the solution involving two strictly sinusodial
% functions and two two functions composed of an exponential and sinusodial
% function, I would predict that a majority of solutions would oscillate
% without decaying or increasing. Since both the c1*e^(-t)*sin(2t) and
% c3*e^(-t)*cos(2t) terms will eventually go to zero, the remaining terms
% will continuously oscillate without decay or growth. The only situations
% in which there will be decay or growth is when the c2 and c4 terms are equal to
% zero, which would only occur in very select initial conditions.
% Therefore, if I were to give a percentage for each of the cases, the
% distribution would be:
% 99% oscillating without decay or growth
% 1% oscillating with decay.

%% Exercise 5
%
% Objective: Classify equations given the roots of the characteristic
% equation.
%
% Details: Your answer can consist of just a short sentence, as |grows| or 
% |decays while oscillating|.
%
% Consider a second-order linear constant coefficient homogeneous DE with
% |r1| and |r2| as roots of the characteristic equation.
%
% Summarize your conclusions about the behaviour of solutions for randomly
% chosen initial data when.
%
% (a) |0 < r1 < r2|

% grows

% (b) |r1 < 0 < r2|

% grows
 
% (c) |r1 < r2 < 0|

% decays

% (d) |r1 = alpha + beta i| and  |r2 = alpha - beta i| and |alpha < 0|

% oscillates with decay

% (e) |r1 = alpha + beta i| and  |r2 = alpha - beta i| and |alpha = 0|

% oscillates without decay or growth

% (f) |r1 = alpha + beta i| and  |r2 = alpha - beta i| and |alpha > 0|

% oscillates with growth

% Conclusions about Behaviour of Solutions:
% Based on the answers to the above examples, I can make conclusions on the
% behaviour of both real and complex solutions. For real solutions, the
% growth/decay behaviour of the solutions is based on the size and sign of
% the roots. If both roots or one root is positive, the solution will grow,
% while the solution will decay if and only if both roots are negative.
% For complex roots, the real portion of the root determines the
% growth/decay behaviour of the solution while the complex component
% determines the oscillating behaviour of the function. If the real part is
% zero, there is no decay or growth while oscillating. If the real part is less than zero,
% the solutions decays while oscillating. If the real part is greater than zero, the solution
% grows while oscillating.

%% Numerical Methods for Second-Order ODEs
%
% One way to create a numerical method for second-order ODEs is to
% approximate derivatives with finite differences in the same way of the
% Euler method.
%
% This means that we approximate the first derivative by:
%
%  y'(t[n]) ~ ( y[n] - y[n-1] ) / h
%
% and
%   
%  y''(t[n])  ~ ( y'(t[n+1]) - y'(t[n]) ) / h ~ ( y[n+1] - 2 y[n] + y[n-1]
%  ) / ( h^2 )
%
% By writing these approximations into the ODE, we obtain a method to get
% |y[n+1]| from the previous two steps |y[n]| and |y[n-1]|.
%
% The method for approximating solutions is:
%
% 1. Start with |y[0]=y0|
%
% 2. Then we need to get |y[1]|, but we can't use the method, because we
% don't have two iterations |y[0]| and |y[-1]|(!!). So we use Euler to get
%
%  y[1] = y0 + y1 h
%
% y1 is the slope given by the initial condition
%
% 3. Use the method described above to get |y[n]| for |n=2,3,...|.

%% Exercise 6
%
% Objective: Write your own second-order ODE solver.
%
% Details: Consider the second-order ODE
%
%  y'' + p(t) y' + q(t) y = g(t)
% 
% Write a second-order ODE solver using the method described above.
% 
% This m-file should be a function which accepts as variables 
% (t0,tN,y0,y1,h), where t0 and tN are the start and end points of the 
% interval on which to solve the ODE, y0, y1 are the initial conditions of
% the ODE, and h is the stepsize.  You may also want to pass the functions 
% into the ODE the way |ode45| does (check MATLAB lab 2). Name the function
% DE2_<UTORid>.m.
%
% Note: you will need to use a loop to do this exercise.  

%% Exercise 7
%
% Objective: Compare your method with |iode|
%
% Details: Use |iode| to plot the solution of the ODE 
% |y'' + exp(-t/5) y' + (1-exp(-t/5)) y = sin(2*t)|
% with the initial conditions 
% |y(0)  = 1, y'(0) = 0|
%
% Use the window to |[0,20]x[-2,2]|
% Without removing the figure window, plot your solution (in a different colour), 
% which will be plotted in the same graph. 
%
% Comment on any major differences, or the lack thereof.
